# Timeless - Student Research Project

### Description
Timeless is a 3D block based game similar to early versions of Minecraft.
The game is written in Java, and uses the Maven build tool.
The game uses LWJGL for rendering.

This is my first time properly making a game like this, so it's bound to not be the best, so take it with a grain of salt if looking through the source.

### Building the Project
To build the project, you must make sure you have `maven` installed.<br>
On Windows, `maven` can be found at [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).<br>
To build, enter the project's root directory, and execute the command: `mvn package`.<br>
When running the project, make sure your working directory also contains the `assets` folder.
